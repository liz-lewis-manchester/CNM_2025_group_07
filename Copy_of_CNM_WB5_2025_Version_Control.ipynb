Often, you will want to go back to a version of your code that you wrote before you made some change that didn't work. We've seen that it is quite easy to make a mistake with your code, or that it is quite easy to break your code. When you start writing longer pieces of code, this becomes more of a problem as there is much more code to wade through to find and trace the error.\n",

We've seen that code can be written in all sorts of places, we have been using jupyter notebooks on colab, but the same code could be run from a text file on a local machine. We therefore can't rely on a track changes function bespoke to a piece of software like in word documents. We need somewhere to save versions of our code with annotations. We do this using software called Git.\n",

        "### What is Git?\n",
        "\n",
        "Git is a version control system- a tool that helps you keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others. Think of it like the version history in Word or Google Docs, but much more powerful. With Git, every change you make to a file can be saved with a commit message (a note describing what and why you changed something). You can then go back to any previous version of your project if something breaks, or see exactly who changed what and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is Git Important for Engineers?\n",
        "\n",
        "In civil engineering projects, we never just have one drawing or one report — we have revisions, updates, and collaboration between many people. Git provides the same for coding projects. Instead of naming files `beam_analysis_v3_FINAL_revised2.py`, Git keeps a clean history of changes inside the project itself. This makes your work:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Safer → you can always recover an older version.\n",
        "* Collaborative → multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Git is the tool on your computer that manages version history.\n",
        "* GitHub is an online platform that stores Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy to share your work and collaborate with others.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub makes it much easier to work in teams and to showcase your projects publicly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Concepts in Git\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Repository (repo):** The project folder that Git is tracking.\n",
        "* **Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a specific moment, with a message describing the change made to the previous version.\n",
        "* **Branch:** A separate line of development, useful when testing new ideas without disturbing the main project.\n",

This is very common in engineering and science: many of the tools we use daily (NumPy, Pandas, OpenSees for structural analysis, QGIS for mapping) are open source. The open source model encourages transparency, collaboration, and innovation, since engineers and researchers worldwide can improve the code, fix errors, and adapt it for their own projects. For civil engineers, this means you don’t always need expensive licenses — you can access powerful tools, learn from the code, and even contribute improvements back to the community.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Findable → Your code should be easy to discover (e.g., hosted on GitHub with clear repository names and keywords).\n",

        "* Accessible → Others should be able to access the code (e.g., a public repository with open licensing).\n",

        "* Interoperable → Code should use standard formats, libraries, and clear documentation so others can integrate it into their own workflows.\n",

        "* Reusable → Your code should be well-documented, licensed, and tested so that others can reuse it confidently in new projects.\n",

        "\n",
        "The first thing we'll do is create a repository. You can think of a repository as a folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders. A repository usually groups together items that belong to the same \"project\" or thing you're working on.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. Click **Confirm merge**. You will receive a message that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.\n",
        "3. Click **Delete branch**. Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on `main`, you can safely delete the `readme-edits` branch. If you want to make more changes to your project, you can always create a new branch and repeat this process.\n",

        "I would reccommend using pytest. To use pytest, you should organise your project so that your main functions are written in a separate Python file (e.g., main_functions.py) and your tests are placed in another file whose name begins with test_ (e.g., test_main_functions.py). Inside the test file, you import the functions you want to test and write small test functions that begin with test_. Each test should check a single behaviour using simple assertions, such as `assert solver(...) == expected_value`. Pytest will automatically find and run any file and function following this naming convention. You can then run all your tests by typing pytest in the terminal from your project directory. This structure keeps your main code clean, makes your functions easier to reuse, and ensures your implementation can be automatically checked.\n",
